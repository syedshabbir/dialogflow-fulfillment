# Dialogflow: Agent 

Ensure at least Node.js v6.9.1 is installed.

## Setup Instructions
1. Within the agent directory, run $ **npm install** to install all of the project's dependencies.
2. In`app.js` replace keyFilename: "bp-agent-c18be-4aafae53b5aa.json" and projectId = "bp-agent-c18be", with your values.
3. With the server running, go to the [Customer interface](http://localhost:3000/customer) in your browser. If all is working correctly, you should see the welcome intent response. You can now use the same conversation scenarios used in the Dialogflow console.
